# The Management Trinity

This cast helps me as a manager explain why I'm using these tools and what their origin is.

## All of the Manager Tools Trinity tools are teachable equivalents

- The problem with management learning is that it's theoretical; Knowing-Doing Gap
- Management learning is rarely about specific actions
- Good management actions can be derived from those managers who are excellent at management
    - People behave certian ways when bosses are given power; focus on the simplicity of these interactions should be the goal
    - Study of the great executives helps to determine what to do; Bill Gates, Jack Welch, Charles Kettering, Alfred Sloan, Jr., Thomas Watson, Henry Ford
    - The two best management books: The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker; and Execution by Larry Bossidy
- The Manager Tools team has worked with 10s of thousands of managers and gained insight into what works and what doesn't
- Boiled great management into an equivalent that you can do now

## One on ones: great managers know their people exceptionally well

All great leaders know their people—directs and skips, and maybe beyond—significantly better than other managers.

- What their strengths are, what their weaknesses are, where they live, their family—the names of the kids, their goals, their history, where they come from, in their career—what they want, when they want it, why they want it—which colleagues they get along with and why, which colleagues they don't get along with and why, how they respond to stress—which stress they thrive with, why they don't respond well to stress.

Information is offered directly by directs. The manager doesn't have to guess at it. The manager has made a plan to get the information. They make knowing their team of directs a key part of their strategy for getting the most out of them. This is regardless of whether they are naturally inclined to this or not.

They see this as critical knowledge. Some will get at it by hiring people they've known for years. They don't shy away from asking about non-work areas. They don't do this stuff naturally because they are people-persons. They do it because they have learned that it makes them significantly more effective then managers who don't do it.

We need a teachable equivalent for getting this knowledge. One-on-ones is the Manager Tools teachable equivalent. This is not the only way to get to know my people, but it is one way that the Manager Tools team has found to be effective.

The one-on-one is a weekly half-hour meeting. There's a specific agenda. There are easy rules to apply to it. Anybody can do it. The way human beings move toward great relationships—open, trusting relationships—is to communicate regularly and frequently. Communication is what the listener does. Because of this, the one-on-one is built around the direct. The manager tools team has tested various versions of one-on-ones: monthly, biweekly, and semi-weekly, hour-long, 20-minutes, and 15-15 agenda.

## Feedback: great managers communicate incessantly about performance

Different parts of the Trinity appeal to different people; there's a part of the Trinity that makes everyone uncomfortable. Feedback is usually uncomfortable for most folks. Great managers talk openly, directly, frankly, candidly, almost politely, in-your-face-ly, and frequently about performance. They are incessant and annoying about it. Almost non-stop.

Directs begin to crave information about how they are doing. If I worked for Welsh or Bossidy, I would know where I stood. Bossidy talks about candor all the time and says I have to be willing to have the tough conversations. This is the most rare natural tendency of managers the MT team know. Tough no-nonsense managers still shy away from these types of conversations. Almost all great managers are exceptionally demanding as well.

We shy away from offering candid feedback because we are afraid of injuring our relationship, because we are afraid of the feedback itself, and we don't know how. The MT feedback model was developed to overcome the not-knowing; as a result, it helps overcome the fear. Doing this frequently, we discover the benefits and the lack of negatives. 

## Coaching: great managers regularly ask for improved performance

Great managers don't leave directs' development to chance. They don't want their directs to be 5% better; they want them 15% better at the end of the year. They don't think goading and feedback are enough. They take an active, hands-on role: goal-setting, training, connecting with network. They set goals and follow up; they don't let their directs off the hook. If the direct lacks drive to improve themself, they are not going to do well working for a high performance manager.

If my standard is to get the most out of my people and do my very best, I've got to ask my people to step up and do better. Just hiring people, knowing them, and providing feedback is not enough. Great managers are never satisfied with only a slow natural improvement curve. They expect, measure, and verify noted improvement in certain areas. There is no coasting upward.

Coaching involves lots of candor and repetition of previously discussed items. The coaching model most closely resembles what many of the great executives do when they sit down and talk to their folks. It's a simple process of four steps: set goals, gather resources, come up with a plan, and the direct acts on that plan. Every great manager coaches everyone who works for them. This is hard in up-times; there's always lots of work to be done. In down-times, developed directs are positioned to make the best difference.

## Delegation: great managers grow organizational capability

This is the fourth "silent" partner of the Management Trinity. The first three are about the direct; this one is about growing the organization. Is the manager giving away work and having the direct take over responsibility for the work. When you look at the key themes that energize great leaders, they give away big chunks of their existing job to train their directs on their existing job. This frees up their time to go after the big opportunities. 

Great managers push stuff down immediately. Part of coaching is giving people a lot of stuff to do and providing them resources to get them where they need to be. Great managers train people by giving them stuff to do. E.g. Walmart, the US Military, and Proctor & Gamble all promote within; this means that lower levels need to know what the person above them does. Great organizations push decision-making down to the lowest level.

Delegation doesn't happen because managers fear the lower performance when a direct has to do it for the first time. Managers who don't do this stay incredibly busy. By giving chuck of my job to my directs, I can help them learn that part of the job in two months or less. When getting it all at once, most managers take six months to learn everything. Organizations which have managers who work on developing their folks tend to have more capability. More delegation means more productivity, which is management's way to get to profitability. Companies with managers who delegate don't have to hire as many people when they grow; this means more profits and a quicker up-turn turn around.

This is more of a script than a model. Managers struggle deciding what to delegate and argue with the MT team regardless of what the MT team recommends turning over. The MT guidance tries to lower the bar of greatness by suggesting steps so that delegation happens smoothly.

## What are the actions we can take

I need to tell my directs why I'm doing this. Include this cast in the rollout. Encourage questions about why I'm doing this. Explain to folks that I'm trying to become more effective. Trust that the more directs understand my efforts, the more they will be able to help me implement them. These tools are meant to help when I'm struggling; I should ask myself what great managers do.
