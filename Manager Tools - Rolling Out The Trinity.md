Manager Tools started as a management consulting firm. The Management Trinity was rolled out by the Manager Tools team. After they started releasing the Trinity publicly, folks would rush through the model, instead of changing them. This fast rollout led to disaster. Learning a new skill takes time; learning as a group takes longer. Rolling out the Trinity all at once is impossible.

## Overview
1. The Trinity is designed to work together
2. Start with one-on-ones
3. Conduct one-on-ones for 12 weeks
4. After 12 weeks of one-on-ones, announce the feedback model in a staff meeting
5. Give positive feedback to top performers first
6. After three to four weeks, add positive feedback to the rest of your team
7. After six to eight more weeks, add negative feedback for top performers
8. What about a top performer asking for negative feedback
9. Following eight weeks of positive and negative feedback, roll out coaching slowly
10. This rollout plan works in a number of situations
11. It can and does work ala carte, but there are dangers
