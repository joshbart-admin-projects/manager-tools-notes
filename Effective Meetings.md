# Effective Meetings - Manager Tools

The Manager Tools team has created a three-part series of podcasts around conducting effective meetings.  They lay out 10 overall strategies listed below:

1. [Pre-publish an agenda](#pre-publish-an-agenda)
2. [Start on time](#start-on-time)
3. [Set some ground rules at the beginning](#set-ground-rules)
4. [Stick to the agenda](#stick-to-the-agenda)
5. [Use a parking lot](#use-a-parking-lot)
6. [Fix responsibilities](#fix-responsibilities)
7. [Finish on time](#finish-on-time)
8. [Publish the minutes](#publish-the-minutes)
9. [Continuously improve](#continuously-improve)
10. [Get a facilitator](#get-a-facilitator)

In the [first podcast](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/08/effective-meetings-get-out-of-jail), they discuss some of the problems that contribute to ineffective meetings, such as people showing up late and leaving early, meetings that run long, and the perception that the meeting is a waste of time (in part because there is no agenda or clear understanding of the purpose of the meeting).  They argue that, because managers spend a significant time in meetings, they should have a protocol for conducting those meetings similar to how paychecks are handled; this leads into their suggested format, complete with a [meeting agenda template](https://files.manager-tools.com/files/private/documents/docs/Sample_Agenda.dot?from=drupal).  Finally, they discuss the first five strategies and how they can bring about improvements in meetings.

In the second podcast, they cover the last five strategies for running effective meetings.

In the third podcast, they answer questions from listeners and provide some clarity on the role of participants in meetings.

## Pre-Publish an agenda

## Start on time

## Set ground rules

- Ground rules for standing meetings should be fairly straight forward; these 10 are a good start
- One at a time rule: if someone is talking, no side conversations.
- No cell phones, pagers, email
- Facilitator must enforce these rules; use politeness and good feedback
- Post the ground rules

## Stick to the agenda

## Use a parking lot

## Fix responsibilities

- After the end of each agenda item, assign to someone.
- Wrap each agenda item: what's going to be done, by who, by when.
- "Bob, you're going to do X by X, _right_?" As it as a question, so that Bob makes a public commitment

## Finish on time

- Really simple if you stick to the agenda.
- Everyone will forgive you for 5 minutes late, if that's all you ever are.
- If you're going to go over, get consensus 15 minutes out.

## Publish the minutes

- This is a frustrating one: doesn't need to be robert's rules of order
- All they are: who said they're going to do what and what we decided on
- If you have one, the admin would normally take notes & publish; if not, rotate who's doing the minutes or have the facilitator do them
- Not a lot of detail; mention reports, but no needed details and no attachments
- Email is fine; vast amount of attachments don't get read
- Goes to everyone who was in the meeting

## Continuously improve

- Ever so often, review ground rules and principles; add as agenda item; opportunity for feedback
- Focus on the process
- Pat people on the back; say thank you to them

## Get a facilitator

- One of the most powerful aspects; most leaders can do these things on their own
- Mike as VP is not going to run his meeting
- Admin could be facilitator; the point is to separate contributors from the person enforcing the ground rules
- As a leader, don't sacrifice the rules

## Q & A

- Do intros allow people to show up late?  No, usually intros only take a minute, then you're into the actual meeting.
- Do I need to have times?  Yes, times make the meeting more effective.
- What meetings should everyone have?  For managers:
  - Daily standup w/ admin; no more than 10 minutes going over the schedule and key things that need to get done today.
  - Weekly staff meeting with all directs; mandatory; should be no more than 60-90 minutes; mostly manager feeding info to directs; never on Monday or Friday
  - Weekly o3s; Monday afternoon through Friday morning
  - Monthly budget/project meeting; Want people to know what our budget is and how much we've spent and how much we have
  - Quarterly with directs; extended o3 with annual review format for that quarter; final quarter is the annual review
  - Annual performance meeting with directs; 60-90 minutes; talk about salary and future
- What meetings not to have?  Meetings that nobody knows why the meeting exists
- Can you do this if other people in the company are not running effective meetings?  Yes!  Probably going to impress higher managers.
- How to participate in meetings you don't run?  Top 10 things to be more effective
  1. Introduce yourself to folks you don't know
  2. Sit with someone you don't know - build relationships with as many people as you can
  3. Be verbal with agreement; builds consensus
  4. Contribute generally
  5. Pre-brief contentious points; don't surprise people
  6. Build support for your ideas before the meeting
  7. Be prepared to answer objections in the meeting
  8. Say goodbye to people
  9. Read the minutes after the meeting
  10. Thank folks for support for the meeting; visit with folks you disagree with
- Are o3s with non-directs appropriate?  Yes, especially if you're running a project that they are contributing significantly to; may want to touch base with their boss
- Should directs be taking notes?  Yes, but don't require it.
