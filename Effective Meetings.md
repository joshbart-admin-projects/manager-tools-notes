# Effective Meetings - Manager Tools

The Manager Tools team has created a three-part series of podcasts around conducting effective meetings.  They lay out 10 overall strategies listed below:

1. [Pre-publish an agenda](#pre-publish-an-agenda)
2. [Start on time](#start-on-time)
3. [Set some ground rules at the beginning](#set-ground-rules)
4. [Stick to the agenda](#stick-to-the-agenda)
5. [Use a parking lot](#use-a-parking-lot)
6. [Fix responsibilities](#fix-responsibilities)
7. [Finish on time](#finish-on-time)
8. [Publish the minutes](#publish-the-minutes)
9. [Continuously improve](#continuously-improve)
10. [Get a facilitator](#get-a-facilitator)

In the [first podcast](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/08/effective-meetings-get-out-of-jail), they discuss some of the problems that contribute to ineffective meetings, such as people showing up late and leaving early, meetings that run long, and the perception that the meeting is a waste of time (in part because there is no agenda or clear understanding of the purpose of the meeting).  They argue that, because managers spend a significant time in meetings, they should have a protocol for conducting those meetings similar to how paychecks are handled; this leads into their suggested format, complete with a [meeting agenda template](https://files.manager-tools.com/files/private/documents/docs/Sample_Agenda.dot?from=drupal).  Finally, they discuss the first five strategies and how they can bring about improvements in meetings.
