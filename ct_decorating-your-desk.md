## Primary Take-aways

Mark recommends six characteristics of a professional employee's desk:

- The desk should be tidy
- Only essential equipment
- One or two pictures of your family
    - No pictures on the beach unless you are fully clothed, sober, and with your small children
- One or two work-appropriate pictures
- A single hard toy
    - No soft toysâ€”i.e. Beanie babies
- A small plant

Mark and Mike do add the caveats that this guidance can be adjusted for especially high performers or managers with large offices.

## Personal Implementation

Following the guidance, I:

- Keep my desk tidy naturally
- Maintain only essential equipment
- Need to add two pictures of Kristi and Adam
- Have a poster of a 1980's advertisement of NES on my wall (Fits company culture)
- Have a 3D-printed fidget spinner on my desk
- Need to add a plant

Deviating from the guidance, I:

- Have supplemented my family photos with a couple of catholic prayer cards
- Have supplemented the work-appropriate pictures with two professional certificates displayed
- Have also supplemented the work-approriate pictures with a desk calendar of images of space
- Have a couple of congratulatory cards on my desk following important events
    - Provides a conversation starter for managers/employees; "Say, was it your birthday/anniversary recently?"
- Have a bookcase containing mostly professional reading materials and my Divine Office prayer book set
