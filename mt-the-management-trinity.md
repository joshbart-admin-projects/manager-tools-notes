# The Management Trinity

This cast helps me as a manager explain why I'm using these tools and what their origin is.

## All of the Manager Tools Trinity tools are teachable equivalents

- The problem with management learning is that it's theoretical; Knowing-Doing Gap
- Management learning is rarely about specific actions
- Good management actions can be derived from those managers who are excellent at management
    - People behave certian ways when bosses are given power; focus on the simplicity of these interactions should be the goal
    - Study of the great executives helps to determine what to do; Bill Gates, Jack Welch, Charles Kettering, Alfred Sloan, Jr., Thomas Watson, Henry Ford
    - The two best management books: The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker; and Execution by Larry Bossidy
- The Manager Tools team has worked with 10s of thousands of managers and gained insight into what works and what doesn't
- Boiled great management into an equivalent that you can do now

## One on ones: great managers know their people exceptionally well

All great leaders know their people—directs and skips, and maybe beyond—significantly better than other managers.

- What their strengths are, what their weaknesses are, where they live, their family—the names of the kids, their goals, their history, where they come from, in their career—what they want, when they want it, why they want it—which colleagues they get along with and why, which colleagues they don't get along with and why, how they respond to stress—which stress they thrive with, why they don't respond well to stress.

Information is offered directly by directs. The manager doesn't have to guess at it. The manager has made a plan to get the information. They make knowing their team of directs a key part of their strategy for getting the most out of them. This is regardless of whether they are naturally inclined to this or not.

They see this as critical knowledge. Some will get at it by hiring people they've known for years. They don't shy away from asking about non-work areas. They don't do this stuff naturally because they are people-persons. They do it because they have learned that it makes them significantly more effective then managers who don't do it.

We need a teachable equivalent for getting this knowledge. One-on-ones is the Manager Tools teachable equivalent. This is not the only way to get to know my people, but it is one way that the Manager Tools team has found to be effective.

The one-on-one is a weekly half-hour meeting. There's a specific agenda. There are easy rules to apply to it. Anybody can do it. The way human beings move toward great relationships—open, trusting relationships—is to communicate regularly and frequently. Communication is what the listener does. Because of this, the one-on-one is built around the direct. The manager tools team has tested various versions of one-on-ones: monthly, biweekly, and semi-weekly, hour-long, 20-minutes, and 15-15 agenda.

## Feedback: great managers communicate incessantly about performance

Different parts of the Trinity appeal to different people; there's a part of the Trinity that makes everyone uncomfortable. Feedback is usually uncomfortable for most folks. Great managers talk openly, directly, frankly, candidly, almost politely, in-your-face-ly, and frequently about performance. They are incessant and annoying about it. Almost non-stop.

Directs begin to crave information about how they are doing.

## Coaching: great managers regularly ask for improved performance

## Delegation: great managers grow organizational capability
