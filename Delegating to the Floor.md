# Delegating to the Floor - Manager Tools

Effective people delegate
Managers are busy, so they delegate. but people are busy, so what do they do?
They delegate to the floor.  It just doesn't get done.

1. Don't not delegate!
Directs told manager that they are always busy.  Manager does not tell his boss that he's too busy.  So, don't accept that from directs.  Managers are fearful that they are doing it wrong.  This plays into the delegation model.  Someone being busy is not the same thing as someone being incapable of doing more work.  Parkin's Law: Work expands to fill the time alotted to do it.  If it can expand, it can contract.  Could have directs that take 50 hours to do stuff in 45 hours.  We mistakenly believe that what we're doing now is the standard.  New work came in, and now we have a new "standard".  




There is a legitimate reason for not delegating.  

2. Ask our direct to prioritize
Direct says "I've got too much." We say, "It's ok."  Show respect.  Ask them to make a list of everything they work on, roughly how long they spend on it, and rank it by the value they think it brings the org.  Usually not more than twenty things.  Folks might have give you a ridiculous statement about 80/week.  Add it up and ask them to do the same, then tell them they are wrong and lack credibility.

3. Ask them to make a recommendation on what won't get done


4. You make the decision yourself
They don't make the decision.  This process is how ICs learn the decision making process

They get push back.  Since you make the decision, others can come back to you.
