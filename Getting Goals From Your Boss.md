# Getting Goals From Your Boss - Manager Tools

GET RESULTS!

1. Do some background work
Embodiment of vagueness of goals is annual reviews.  No clarity on goals.  Email asking about this might be a bad idea depending on the boss for a number of reasons.
Ideal is to tell each directs "here's what I want you to work on, here's what the measures are, and here's what the goals are"
Take a month; assume you won't need your bosses input
Effort has three parts
- Work you do
- How you measure (time may be a factor in this too; people, money, time, and quality are all factors)
- Standards within measures for performance

Example: In geometry class,
- The work I'm doing is geometry problems
- How to measure it is how many problems I get right or wrong
- The standard is how I'm going to be graded

Sources (None may be fully accurate, but provide data. Need high quantity. Start a list of things you learn from each):
Job description - may not have one, but it could have some good nuggets. May be in HR; if they can't find it, might not be worth finding.
Virtual job description - rough estimate by asking questions
  - The reason the company created this job is ____
  - The most important ways a person doing this job should spend their time are ____
  - The two to three most important duties of this job are _____
  - What this job takes to be successful is ____
  - The simplest, easiest way to see if this job is being done well is ____
Ask peers; might have job description; what they get evaluated on might be insightful; "trying to get clear on what my goals are.  You got anything?"
Review your last performance review; metrics might be on the review; if you've updated resume every quarter, might be imporant accomplishments worth adding to list, pointers to metrics; look for themes
Check recent job advertisements; look for yours or for your peers; if something is there that you don't do, make a note
One on Ones notes - What does your boss pay attention to on a regular basis: 
  - What do you get praised for?
  - What does your boss ask for a status of the most?
  - What does he get stressed about?
  - What do you get in trouble for?
Skim email and calendar; look for reminders of projects that cropped up; short term efforts
Not exhaustive - should also check Jira tasks and RTM tasks for me

2. Do some preparation with that background work
3. Understand your risk - the conversation with the boss is not risk free
4. Request time - not blindly, what am I doing and why am I doing it, ask for help, not answers
5. Expect a lack of clarity
