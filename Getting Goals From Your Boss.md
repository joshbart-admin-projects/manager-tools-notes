# Getting Goals From Your Boss - Manager Tools

GET RESULTS!

## 1. Do some background work

*Setting the stage:* There is typically no clarity on goals and bosses may not have clearly identified them. The embodiment of this vagueness regarding goals is annual reviews. You could email the boss, but asking about this might be a bad idea depending on your boss for a number of reasons. The ideal scenario is that each boss would tell his/her directs the following: "Here's what I want you to work on; here's what the measures are; and here's what the goals are."

The first point of this guidance is to take it slow. This could take as much as a month. Assume for now that you won't need your boss' input. Assume that there's a way to figure out the answer yourself. You should get to 95% of the way there.

The effort to determine your goals has three parts:

1. The work you do
2. How you are going to measure the work (time may be a factor in this too; people, money, time, and quality are all factors)
3. The standards within measures for performance (Likely to be a complete guess; don't worry that you don't know what standard your boss will apply)

Example: In geometry class,

1. The work I'm doing is geometry problems
2. How to measure it is how many problems I get right or wrong
3. The standard is how I'm going to be graded

### Sources for data

The overall goal is not to find answers or get fixated on one source of data. What we want is lots of data to be able to analyze after the fact; quantity is the important factor here. None of this data may be fully accurate. You should start a list of things you learn from the sources to start putting together a set of measures.

**Job description** - You may not have one, but it could have some good nuggets. We are not looking for answers, just good data. You may be able to ask HR for this. If they can't find it, might not be worth finding.

**Virtual job description** - This is the job description that doesn't exist, but can be assertained by asking questions about the job.

- The reason the company created this job is ____
- The most important ways a person doing this job should spend their time are ____
- The two to three most important duties of this job are ____
- What this job takes to be successful is ____
- The simplest, easiest way to see if this job is being done well is ____

**Ask your peers** - They might have a job description. What they get evaluated on might be insightful. "I'm trying to get clear on what my goals are. Do you have anything in the way of job descriptions?"

**Review your last performance review** - Metrics might be on the review. If you've updated resume every quarter, there might be imporant accomplishments worth adding to list. Accomplishments are pointers to key metrics. Accomplishments might be random, so look for themes.

**Check recent job advertisements** - look for the job advertisement for you or your peers. If something is there that you don't do, make a note about it.

**One on Ones notes** - What does your boss pay attention to on a regular basis:

- What do you get praised for?
- What does your boss ask for a status of the most?
- What does he get stressed about?
- What do you get in trouble for?

**Skim email and calendar** - Just scan this. Look for reminders of projects that cropped up and short term efforts that may have been missed.

This list is not exhaustive. This should get a good idea of what my boss expects

## 2. Do some preparation with that background work

Hardest step - Goals and metrics aren't what you do, but they are measures of how well you do it
What we're faced with is the measures; If you have those, you're lucky!
Whatever you choose as a measure, make sure it is something you can measure.  Don't use something that isn't already tracked or that you don't have the time to create the tracking process for.  It's ok if you don't measure these things perfectly.
Objection: But my job is unmeasurable!  Rebuttal: Is there someone on your team that's really good?  Is there someone on your team that's not so good?  What are the differences?  That's what to measure.
A good way to measure stuff is to create a proxy - use a measurement that reasonably represents what you're trying to measure.  Example: NFL has an annual combine for draftees; tests are bench press and 40-yard dash.  No pro player will do a bench press in a game.  Bench press is not a perfect predictor of success in games, but instead a general indicator of strength.
Good proxies: Think of sub-behaviors of the work-product behavior: see more MT guidance
5 behaviors:
- The words you say
- How you say them
- Your facial expressions
- Your body language
- Your work-product
  - Quality: How much work do you and your team do?  How many forms do you process? How many tasks do you complete? (Marks' favorite)
  - Quantity: How did your team's work compare to a defect standard? How many shipments were returned? How many rewrites did your code require?
  - Accuracy: How few errors did your team have in all or part of its work? What was your deviance against predictions? How many of your team's bugs did QA have to fix?
  - Timeliness: How many project deadlines did you meet? How many projects were delivered on time?
  - Documentation: What percentage of reports were on time?
  - Safety: How many safety incidents did your team have? How many safety meetings did your team attend?
Also need to talk about strategic categories:
- People: What percentage of your team met their deliverables? What percentage of your team were given top quintile ratings? How many team members were considered for high-potential status? What portion of your team receive merit increases? What portion of your team completed their development plans for the year?
- Retention: What was your quarterly/annual retention rate? Did you lose any high-potential performers? What was your team's engagement score average from the annual employee survey?


(Some thoughts as I listen to this.  If I use the Phoenix model of security work, I can start to identify some metrics right away.  For IR: how many IR tickets are open?  How long have they been open?  For SecOps: are dailies being completed on time? Are audits being completed on time?  For SecEng: How many new/updated controls were implemented each quarter?  For business analysis: what was the turn around time on each last minute project?)

## 3. Understand your risk - the conversation with the boss is not risk free

Would not recommend a proxy if I had not measured against it for a while.  Don't shoot yourself in the head.
I should be able to meet the objectives I recommend.

## 4. Request time - not blindly, what am I doing and why am I doing it, ask for help, not answers

## 5. Expect a lack of clarity
