# Getting Goals From Your Boss - Manager Tools

GET RESULTS!

1. Do some background work
Embodiment of vagueness of goals is annual reviews.  No clarity on goals.  Email asking about this might be a bad idea depending on the boss for a number of reasons.
Ideal is to tell each directs "here's what I want you to work on, here's what the measures are, and here's what the goals are"
Take a month; assume you won't need your bosses input
Effort has three parts
- Work you do
- How you measure (time may be a factor in this too; people, money, time, and quality are all factors)
- Standards within measures for performance

Example: In geometry class,
- The work I'm doing is geometry problems
- How to measure it is how many problems I get right or wrong
- The standard is how I'm going to be graded

Sources (None may be fully accurate, but provide data. Need high quantity. Start a list of things you learn from each):
Job description - may not have one, but it could have some good nuggets. May be in HR; if they can't find it, might not be worth finding.
Virtual job description - rough estimate by asking questions
  - The reason the company created this job is ____
  - The most important ways a person doing this job should spend their time are ____
  - The two to three most important duties of this job are _____
  - What this job takes to be successful is ____
  - The simplest, easiest way to see if this job is being done well is ____
Ask peers; might have job description; what they get evaluated on might be insightful; "trying to get clear on what my goals are.  You got anything?"
Review your last performance review; metrics might be on the review; if you've updated resume every quarter, might be imporant accomplishments worth adding to list, pointers to metrics; look for themes
Check recent job advertisements; look for yours or for your peers; if something is there that you don't do, make a note
One on Ones notes - What does your boss pay attention to on a regular basis: 
  - What do you get praised for?
  - What does your boss ask for a status of the most?
  - What does he get stressed about?
  - What do you get in trouble for?
Skim email and calendar; look for reminders of projects that cropped up; short term efforts
Not exhaustive - should also check Jira tasks and RTM tasks for me

2. Do some preparation with that background work
Hardest step - Goals and metrics aren't what you do, but they are measures of how well you do it
What we're faced with is the measures; If you have those, you're lucky!
Whatever you choose as a measure, make sure it is something you can measure.  Don't use something that isn't already tracked or that you don't have the time to create the tracking process for.  It's ok if you don't measure these things perfectly.
Objection: But my job is unmeasurable!  Rebuttal: Is there someone on your team that's really good?  Is there someone on your team that's not so good?  What are the differences?  That's what to measure.
A good way to measure stuff is to create a proxy - use a measurement that reasonably represents what you're trying to measure.  Example: NFL has an annual combine for draftees; tests are bench press and 40-yard dash.  No pro player will do a bench press in a game.  Bench press is not a perfect predictor of success in games, but instead a general indicator of strength.
Good proxies: Think of sub-behaviors of the work-product behavior: see more MT guidance
5 behaviors:
- The words you say
- How you say them
- Your facial expressions
- Your body language
- Your work-product
  - Quality: How much work do you and your team do?  How many forms do you process? How many tasks do you complete? (Marks' favorite)
  - Quantity: How did your team's work compare to a defect standard? How many shipments were returned? How many rewrites did your code require?
  - Accuracy: How few errors did your team have in all or part of its work? What was your deviance against predictions? How many of your team's bugs did QA have to fix?
  - Timeliness: How many project deadlines did you meet? How many projects were delivered on time?
  - Documentation: What percentage of reports were on time?
  - Safety: How many safety incidents did your team have? How many safety meetings did your team attend?
Also need to talk about strategic categories:
- People: What percentage of your team met their deliverables? What percentage of your team were given top quintile ratings? How many team members were considered for high-potential status? What portion of your team receive merit increases? What portion of your team completed their development plans for the year?
- Retention: What was your quarterly/annual retention rate? Did you lose any high-potential performers? What was your team's engagement score average from the annual employee survey?


(Some thoughts as I listen to this.  If I use the Phoenix model of security work, I can start to identify some metrics right away.  For IR: how many IR tickets are open?  How long have they been open?  For SecOps: are dailies being completed on time? Are audits being completed on time?  For SecEng: How many new/updated controls were implemented each quarter?  For business analysis: what was the turn around time on each last minute project?)

3. Understand your risk - the conversation with the boss is not risk free
Would not recommend a proxy if I had not measured against it for a while.  Don't shoot yourself in the head.
I should be able to meet the objectives I recommend.

4. Request time - not blindly, what am I doing and why am I doing it, ask for help, not answers
5. Expect a lack of clarity
